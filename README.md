# Training
Here you can find training material for both computer science and life sciences students joining the Genorobotics MAKE project. It contains resources on collaborative coding using Github, provides an introduction to Python and biological computing using BioPython as well as molecular biology basics to understand what is going on behind the code.

## Collaborative Coding with Github
- [Using Git and Github](Using_Git_and_Github.pdf): a step-by-step tutorial on using git for version control, branching and merging, collaborating on Github, merge conflicts and pull requests
- [Git cheatsheet](git_cheat_sheet.pdf): a handy cheatsheet with the most important terminal commands

## Biology
- [Molecular Biology Basics](Molecular_Biology_Basics.pdf): a compilation of resources to understand the biology behind our technology, DNA, PCR, sequecing, DNA Barconding, fasta/fastq file formats and alignment algorithms

## Biopython
- [BioPython tutorial](intro_to_biopython\GenoRobotics_bioinfo_tutorial.ipynb): introduction to Anaconda for package management, Python Basics and basic bioinformatics operations with BioPython

## NCBI
- [Introduction to NCBI](intro_to_ncbi\intro_to_ncbi.ipynb): a two-part tutorial on how to access NCBI's databases both manually online and by code through the E-utilities
- [Exploring GenBank and BLASTn online](intro_to_ncbi\Exploring_GenBank_and_BLASTn_online.pdf): Part One of said tutorial, how to check individual entries and download filtered databases online, how to use BLASTn for sequence alignment and interpret the results.
- [NCBI Entrez Utilities Help](intro_to_ncbi\ncbi_entrez_eutilities_help.pdf): an important reference for using NCBI's E-utilities, complementary to Part Two of the tutorial.
